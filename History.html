                    <h3>Early history</h3><p>The first known examples of a team game involving a ball, which was made out of a rock, occurred in old Mesoamerican cultures for over 3,000 years ago. According to the sources, the ball would symbolize the sun and the captain of the losing team would be sacrificed to the gods. The first known ball game which also  involved kicking took place In China in the 3rd and 2nd century BC under the name Cuju. Cuju was played with a round ball on an area of a square. It later spread to Japan and was practiced under ceremonial forms. </p>

                    <h3> First football clubs</h3><p>Football clubs have existed since the 15th century, but unorganized and without official status. It is therefore hard to decide which the first football club was. In the beginning, football was dominated by public school teams, but later, teams consisting by workers would make up the majority. The motivation behind paying players was not only to win more matches. In the 1880s the interest in the game has moved ahead to a level that tickets were sold to the matches. And finally, in 1885 professional football was legalized and three years later the Football League was established.</p>

                    <h3>First competitions</h3><p>  Football Association Challenge Cup (FA Cup) became the first important competition when it was run in 1871. The following year a match between two national teams was played for the first time. The match that involved England and Scotland ended 0-0 and was followed by 4,000 people at Hamilton Crescent. Twelve years later, in 1883, the first international tournament took place and included four national teams: England, Ireland, Scotland and Wales. </p>

                    <h3>The Great Modern Competitions</h3><p>No other sport event besides the Summer Olympic Games can today measure itself with the FIFA World Cup. The first edition of the FIFA World Cup was played in 1930 in Uruguay and has since then returned every fourth year (with two exceptions due to the Second World War). In 1991 the first World Cup for women was held in China and has since then also returned every fourth year.Today the biggest global tournament for clubs is the Champions League (played since 1992), the former European Cup (1955–1991).</p>
