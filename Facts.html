                      <p> The biggest victory ever achieved by a team in an official match occurred in 2002 in Madagascar, when the host team won 149 – 0. This happened because the visiting team protested against the referee and began scoring own goals throughout the match. However, the biggest win in an international match was between Australia and American Samoa, when the Australians won 31 – 0.</p>

                      <p> In football it is very rare to see a goalkeeper score a goal, but some players on this position have proven that to be wrong. The Brazilian keeper Rogério Ceni holds the record for most goals scored by a goalkeeper – 131 goals! The only goalkeeper to score a hat-trick is the Paraguayan José Luis Chilavert in 1999 and the longest goal ever was scored by the Korean Koo Sang-min, with a measured shot length of 100 meters!</p>

                      <p>The first person to think about yellow and red cards was referee Ken Aston during the 1962 World Cup in a match between Italy and Chile. The two nations had political tension between them and during the match many players acted very aggressively, kicking and knocking down enemy players. After the match Aston proposed the idea of colored cards to FIFA. He said he thought of the idea from red and yellow traffic lights.</p>
